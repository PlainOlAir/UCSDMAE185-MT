General Code Organization:

%% initializaion

    Define physical parameters and simulation parameters
    Initialize grid (use ndgrid)
    Initialize primitive variables
    Initialize conservative variables
    Preallocate other arrays with zeros (E, F, Ubar, etc.)
    Compute initial physical parameters (speed of sound, viscosity, etc)

%% time loop

    Make sure conservative and primitive variables are up to date
    Optional: Compute delta_t based on stability requirement and most recent solution fields
    Update t
    Predictor Step
        Update all necessary physical parameters
        Compute partial derivatives of primitive variables needed to assemble flux array E
          Be sure to maintain overall accuracy by properly biasing x- and y- derivatives! (See lecture notes)
        Update E
        Compute partial derivatives of primitive variables needed to assemble flux vector F
          Be sure to maintain overall accuracy by properly biasing x- and y- derivatives!
        Update F
        Compute Ubar (using forward differences for derivatives of E and F)
        Update primitive variables
        Enforce BCs on primitive variables
        Update Ubar
    Corrector Step
        Follow predictor steps 1-4, but using values from U, 
          and with the proper biasing needed to maintain overall accuracy in the corrector step!
        Compute U (using backward differences for derivatives of Ebar and Fbar)
        Update primitive variables
        Enforce BCs on primitive variables
        Update U
    Data output/visualization
